            <h3>Post-Doc Researcher</h3>
            <p><strong>Institute for Digital Medicine (IDM), Augsburg University Hospital</strong></p>
            <p><strong>12/2021 - Present</strong> | Augsburg, Germany</p>
            <p>At IDM, I work on the SAFICU project, which aims to revolutionize patient care in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) by applying federated learning techniques. This project involves developing AI models that can work across multiple institutions while preserving patient privacy. My role includes conducting advanced research on federated learning and explainable AI, mentoring students, and contributing to high-impact publications and international conferences.</p>
            <p>Key responsibilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designing and implementing federated learning frameworks for real-time ICU monitoring.</li>
                <li>Developing models that balance interpretability and accuracy to assist healthcare professionals.</li>
                <li>Overseeing the research progress of M.Sc. and B.Sc. students, guiding them through their projects.</li>
                <li>Publishing findings in leading journals and presenting at global conferences to share insights and advancements.</li>
